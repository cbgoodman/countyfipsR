<Intro>

## Getting Data
There are two methods for getting data from `countyfipsR`. First, `countyfipsR` contains a `tibble` data frame, `countyfips`, for easily accessing unfiltered county data.

```{r countydata}
library(countyfipsR)

head(countyfips)
```

The second method, `get_countyfips` allows for easy filtering of data by state. Simply, specify the state or territory you would like, and `get_countyfips` returns a `tibble` of the requested data.

```{r get_countyfips}
dataIL <- get_countyfips(state = "illinois")

head(dataIL)
```
